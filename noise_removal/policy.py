"""
Dilated causal convolution feature extractor for noise cancellation.

Inspired by the DeepMind Deep Loop Shaping work (arXiv:2509.14016), which
replaces LSTM hidden state with a small MLP + dilated convolution input layer.
Dilated causal convolutions (WaveNet-style) provide:

  - Large receptive field with few parameters: RF = 1 + (k-1)·sum(2^i)
  - No vanishing gradients over long sequences (unlike LSTM)
  - Fast inference: all time steps computed in parallel during training
  - Strictly causal: no future information leaks into the representation

Architecture (default: 6 layers, kernel=3, dilation doubles each layer):

    Layer 0: dilation=1,  RF contribution = 2
    Layer 1: dilation=2,  RF contribution = 4
    Layer 2: dilation=4,  RF contribution = 8
    Layer 3: dilation=8,  RF contribution = 16
    Layer 4: dilation=16, RF contribution = 32
    Layer 5: dilation=32, RF contribution = 64
                                           ───
    Total receptive field = 1 + 2+4+8+16+32+64 = 127 samples  (> window_size=64)

The extractor reshapes the flat observation vector into (n_channels, window_size)
before applying the convolutions.
